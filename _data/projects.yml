    In the past, Jessie’s Kids Foundation used a paper-based funds allocation
    system, that was slow, inefficient, and expensive. We created an online
    system where the funds can be requested and approved by members of the
    foundation.

    To help their goal of protecting natural areas, we were tasked to create a
    mobile application where users can view Niches’ parks and take self-guided
    tours on the trails. The app also displayed information for landmarks along
    the trails to make the tours interesting.
