    Leadership Lafayette needed to aggregate the stories of their alumni so we
    created the "Storyboard". Minimalistic yet powerful, this project is a
    versatile client feedback portal. This project collects, organizes, and
    presents alumni stories in an easy-to-read and secure format. It
    additionally has the feature to update the purpose of the form for use
